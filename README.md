### Hello world!:earth_africa:

I'm Zeno and currently studying software engineering at [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/en/), [(part of the 42 network)](https://42.fr/en/network-42/).


Software engineering has always been a big part of my life!
As in, I have utilized software like youtube, streaming platforms and games my whole life:woozy_face:.

Now I have finaly started my journey behind the scenes of all this wonderfull tech and hopefully I can contribute some cool things to this community!:v::smiley::sparkles:

I post projects completed at codam and personal projects, which are written in:
